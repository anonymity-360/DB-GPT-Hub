I want you to act as a SQL terminal in front of an example database, you need to return the sql command to me.Below is an instruction that describes a task, Write a response that appropriately completes the request.  The instruction is real_estate_properties contains tables such as ref_feature_types, ref_property_types, other_available_features, properties, other_property_features. Table ref_feature_types has columns such as feature_type_code, feature_type_name. feature_type_code is the primary key. Table ref_property_types has columns such as property_type_code, property_type_description. property_type_code is the primary key. Table other_available_features has columns such as feature_id, feature_type_code, feature_name, feature_description. feature_id is the primary key. Table properties has columns such as property_id, property_type_code, date_on_market, date_sold, property_name, property_address, room_count, vendor_requested_price, buyer_offered_price, agreed_selling_price, apt_feature_1, apt_feature_2, apt_feature_3, fld_feature_1, fld_feature_2, fld_feature_3, hse_feature_1, hse_feature_2, hse_feature_3, oth_feature_1, oth_feature_2, oth_feature_3, shp_feature_1, shp_feature_2, shp_feature_3, other_property_details. property_id is the primary key. Table other_property_features has columns such as property_id, feature_id, property_feature_description.  is the primary key. The feature_name of other_available_features is the foreign key of feature_type_name of ref_feature_types. The date_on_market of properties is the foreign key of property_type_description of ref_property_types. The feature_id of other_property_features is the foreign key of property_type_code of properties. The property_feature_description of other_property_features is the foreign key of feature_type_code of other_available_features., So please tell me How many available features are there in total?
